RAISE member [Aoibhinn Ni Shuilleabhain](https://www.raise-stem.ie/author/aoibhinn-ni-shuilleabhain/), with her colleague Catherine Mooney, recently launched their 'Role Models in pSTEM: You can be what you can see' project to promote and encourage careers in physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering. A series of 10 videos of diverse role models, from electricians to software engineers, are showcased in the videos and resources include a teacher booklet and slide deck. The project was a collaboration with UCD, TU Dublin and Atlantic Technological University and was funded by the HEA and the Institute of Physics.
