Dr. Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin is an Assistant Professor in the School of Mathematics & Statistics where she is director of the BSc. Science, Mathematics & Education initial teacher education programme in the UCD College of Science. Her research investigates issues in Mathematics Education, with particular focus on teacher education, and on making STEM more accessible and exciting for those who have historically been left out, whether because they are underprivileged economically or because they are female. A former post-primary teacher, she is committed to making the teaching of mathematics more effective and this commitment has taken her well out of the university classroom as a science communicator on TV, radio and in print.

Aoibhinn has published nationally and internationally on her research and plays an active role in a number of national and international networks. She is the Irish representative on the WALS (World Association of Lesson Study) Council and is a member of the Irish Mathematical Society Education sub-committee. She is also a member of the STEM Education Policy Review Group and Gender in STEM group with the Department of Education. She is a co-founder of the MELSE (Mathematics Education in Lesson Study Europe) research group, which comprises of members from several countries who meet biennially to share their work. 

Nominated by colleagues, she won a 2020 UCD Values in Action award for her role as a socially engaged academic, communicator and leader.  In 2020 she won the Maths Week Ireland Award and in 2017 won the SFI Outstanding Contribution to STEM Communication Award for her work promoting mathematics and science. She has been awarded runner up Research Impact prizes in 2018 and 2022 from UCD for her work on Lesson Study with Irish mathematics teachers and promoting gender equality in STEM. In 2017 she was named as a European Young Leader, a group nominated to facilitate and create a more equal, innovative and inclusive Europe."
