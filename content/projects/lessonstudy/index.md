## **Project description**
This project is broadly concerned with advancing the knowledge base on Lesson Study as a model of continuing professional development for STEM teachers. A critical aspect of this broad goal is to investigate and isolate the motivational antecedents that contribute to a teacher's initial and continuing engagement in the approach. The research is currently concerned with exploring some of the psychological variables (teaching self-efficacy & attitudes to lesson study/professional developmeny) that may contribute to practicing teachers attitudes towards the model of CPD.
