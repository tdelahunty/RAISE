abstract: This paper presents a research framework for investigating the role of language use in mathematics learning. The paper draws on the wider M2EID study, which explores whether differences in languages (English and Irish) and their use by bilingual mathematical students have a differential impact on their mathematics meta-level developments. A primary consideration of the M2EID study was to design a rigorous research framework to support such complex, real-world educational research. In particular, the study explored how to integrate the varied theoretical constructs underpinning this type of research and how to design the most appropriate data capture and analysis procedures. It is focused on adapting a discursive approach to examining bilingual students' mathematical thinking. The resultant LCM2 research framework outlines four phases for designing research within the combined fields of linguistics and mathematics. Exemplars from the M2EID study are provided.
