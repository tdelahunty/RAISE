abstract: Lesson study has received significant attention in recent years as an effective model of professional development among mathematics teachers. As it is a model of professional development premised on teacher autonomy and based on practitioners’ direct involvement, it is unique in its offering as a form of CPD. Lesson study has been practiced in Ireland since the introduction of “Project Maths” in 2008. There is some evidence that highlights the effectiveness of the model in improving pedagogical practices and consequently student learning in the Irish context, which aligns with the international literature however, far less is known about the impact on teachers’ motivations or attitudes or the predispositions necessary to participate in lesson study. In the broader professional development literature positive attitudes to self-development and teaching self-efficacy have both been shown to moderate a teacher’s intention to participate in PD. The current study aimed to address this dearth in the lesson study literature and drawing upon the integrated model of teacher motivation (de Jesus & Lens, 2005), proposed 3 core hypotheses; 1) A positive attitude to self-development would predict engagement in lesson study, 2) The number of cycles of lesson study a teacher participates in would correlate with higher teaching self-efficacy, 3)Teaching self-efficacy would predict positive attitudes towards lesson study. A survey method was adopted using a set of pre-validated scales from the literature to measure attitudes to lesson study and mathematics teaching self-efficacy. 64 practicing secondary mathematics teachers participated in the anonymous electronic survey encompassing a range of career stages and various levels of participation in lesson study. Data was analysed using a generalised linear modelling approach. Core findings indicate that perceived teaching self-efficacy for mathematics is a significant predictor of a teachers’ attitudes to lesson study and the central importance of positive attitudes towards self-development was also highlighted. The findings build upon previous knowledge in this field and demonstrate the significance of teaching self-efficacy as a presage variable for developing a positive disposition towards lesson study. This has significant implications for our understanding of this model of professional development as it may be the case that teachers who possess lower levels of perceived teaching self-efficacy in mathematics may be less likely to engage.
