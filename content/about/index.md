The ***Research, Application, and Inclusion in STEM Education*** **(RAISE)** research group was formed by a group of academics working in a variety of areas of STEM education. The group has a core emphasis on conducting research and promoting inclusion in the broad area of STEM education both within Ireland and internationally. Initially, the group provided a means of collaboration for members beyond the borders of individual academic institutions and we maintain a strong culture of collaboration and support amongst members. 

The group conducts research across all levels of STEM education, within singular disciplines of STEM or in interdisciplinary conceptions. Group members conduct research across a variety of areas such as:

- Mathematics education 
- Technology & engineering education 
- Teacher education 
- Subject specific pedagogies 
- Assessment
- Lesson study
- Professional development 
- Cognition, problem solving & reasoning across STEM
- Presage variables 
- Policy and practice 
- Contemporary research methods for STEM education
- Bilingualism and performance in STEM 
- Critical theory


The group is structured around a core committee, steered by a Chair, that sits for a period of 3 years. Full details of the membership and committee are available in the ['Members'](../people/people.md) section of the website. 



The group is privileged to have a wide network of colleagues and regularly collaborates with external institutions and industry outside of academia. One of the core strengths of RAISE lies in its membership being distributed across a number if higher education institutions and unlike traditional research groups, we are always open to considering new members and partnerships.
