The book is intended to be a resource for those interested in the field of STEM education and in particular conducting research in these  contexts. The book will present an edited collection of contributions from invited lead authors covering philosophical and epistemological considerations on the field of STEM education research as a whole. In addition, there are contributions from researchers in the field of STEM education who have conducted and concluded various studies using innovative methodological implementations across the spectrum of educational provision. These  chapters  cover the key conceptual and theoretical rationales for the authors’ study as well as detailed explanations of the design and implementation of the respective methodologies and handling of data analyses. The authors provide key suggestions for further learning and development of the reader in relation to the content of the specific chapter. The book should help the reader develop an understanding and appreciation for research in STEM education as an epistemological undertaking as well as developing knowledge of key methodologies and practical undertaking of research. While there are several compendiums on STEM education in the available literature, these primarily focus on the developing field of STEM education or on the specific methods of teaching and learning within the discipline. To our knowledge, this is the first volume that attempts to provide methodological guidance, in terms of both theoretical and applied considerations, for the contemporary STEM education researcher and should be a valuable addition to graduate education in the field.

The book is available to pre-order from the **22nd of September, 2022** and will be available from the **13th of October**.
